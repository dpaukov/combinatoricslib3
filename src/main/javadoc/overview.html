Combinatoricslib 3.3.0 is a combinatorial objects stream generator for Java 8.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Library can generate the following combinatorial objects:
        <ul>
            <li>All possible simple combinations of a vector</li>
            <li>All possible multi-combinations (with repetitions) of a vector</li>
            <li>All possible permutations with and without repetitions of a vector</li>
            <li>All possible sub-sets of a set</li>
            <li>Cartesian product of multiple lists</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3> 1. Simple permutations </h3>
<p>A permutation is an ordering of a set in the context of all possible orderings. For example, the set
    containing the first three digits, 123, has six permutations: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, and 321.
<p>
    This is an example of the permutations of the 3 string items (apple, orange, cherry):
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
    Generator.permutation("apple", "orange", "cherry")
    .simple()
    .stream()
    .forEach(System.out::println);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The result of 6 permutations
<blockquote>
<pre>
    [apple, orange, cherry]
    [apple, cherry, orange]
    [cherry, apple, orange]
    [cherry, orange, apple]
    [orange, cherry, apple]
    [orange, apple, cherry]
</pre>
</blockquote>

This generator can produce the permutations <b>even if an initial vector has duplicates</b>. For example,
all permutations of (1, 1, 2, 2):

<blockquote>
<pre>
    Generator.permutation(1, 1, 2, 2)
    .simple()
    .stream()
    .forEach(System.out::println);
</pre>
</blockquote>

The result of all possible permutations (with duplicates)
<blockquote>
<pre>
    [1, 1, 2, 2]
    [1, 2, 1, 2]
    [1, 2, 2, 1]
    [2, 1, 1, 2]
    [2, 1, 2, 1]
    [2, 2, 1, 1]
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h3> 2. Permutations with repetitions </h3>
Permutation may have more elements than slots. For example, all possible permutation of '12'
in three slots are: 111, 211, 121, 221, 112, 212, 122, and 222.

Let's generate all possible permutations with repetitions of 3 elements from the set of apple and orange.

<blockquote>
<pre>
List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; permutations = Generator
    .permutation("apple", "orange")
    .withRepetitions(3)
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;toList());

    permutations.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And the result of 8 permutations

<blockquote>
<pre>
    [apple, apple, apple]
    [orange, apple, apple]
    [apple, orange, apple]
    [orange, orange, apple]
    [apple, apple, orange]
    [orange, apple, orange]
    [apple, orange, orange]
    [orange, orange, orange]
</pre>
</blockquote>


<h3> 3. Simple combinations</h3>
<p>
    A simple k-combination of a finite set S is a subset of k distinct elements of S.
    Specifying a subset does not arrange them in a particular order. As an example, a poker hand can
    be described as a 5-combination of cards from a 52-card deck: the 5 cards of the hand are all distinct,
    and the order of the cards in the hand does not matter.
<p>
    Let's generate all 3-combination of the set of 5 colors (red, black, white, green, blue).

<blockquote>
<pre>
    List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; combinations = Generator.combination("red", "black", "white", "green", "blue")
    .simple(3)
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;toList());
    combinations.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And the result of 10 combinations
<blockquote>
<pre>
    [red, black, white]
    [red, black, green]
    [red, black, blue]
    [red, white, green]
    [red, white, blue]
    [red, green, blue]
    [black, white, green]
    [black, white, blue]
    [black, green, blue]
    [white, green, blue]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3> 4. Multi-combinations</h3>
<p>A k-multicombination or k-combination with repetition of a finite set S is given by a sequence of
    k not necessarily distinct elements of S, where order is not taken into account.
<p>
    As an example. Suppose there are 2 types of fruits (apple and orange) at a grocery store, and you
    want to buy 3 pieces of fruit. You could select
<blockquote>
<pre>
- (apple, apple, apple)
- (apple, apple, orange)
- (apple, orange, orange)
- (orange, orange, orange)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Example. Generate 3-combinations with repetitions of the set (apple, orange). You can pass an array
    as a parameter of the function.
<blockquote>
<pre>
    Generator.combination(new String[] { "apple", "orange" })
    .multi(3)
    .stream()
    .forEach(System.out::println);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>
    [apple, apple, apple]
    [apple, apple, orange]
    [apple, orange, orange]
    [orange, orange, orange]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3> 5. Subsets</h3>
<p>A set A is a subset of a set B if A is "contained" inside B. A and B may coincide.
    The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment.
<p>Examples:
<p>The set (1, 2) is a proper subset of (1, 2, 3).
<p>Any set is a subset of itself, but not a proper subset.
<p>The empty set, denoted by ∅, is also a subset of any given set X.
<p>All subsets of (1, 2, 3) are:
<blockquote>
<pre>
    - ()
    - (1)
    - (2)
    - (1, 2)
    - (3)
    - (1, 3)
    - (2, 3)
    - (1, 2, 3)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a piece of code that generates all possible subsets of (one, two, three)
<blockquote>
<pre>
    List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; subsets = Generator
    .subset("one", "two", "three")
    .simple()
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;toList());
    subsets.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And the result of all possible 8 subsets
<blockquote>
<pre>
    []
    [one]
    [two]
    [one, two]
    [three]
    [one, three]
    [two, three]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3> 6. Integer Partitions</h3>
<p>In number theory, a partition of a positive integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive
    integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered to be the same partition;
    if order matters then the sum becomes a composition. A summand in a partition is also called a part.

<p>The partitions of 5 are listed below:
<blockquote>
<pre>
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1
3 + 1 + 1
3 + 2
4 + 1
5
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's generate all possible partitions of 5:
<blockquote>
<pre>
   Generator.partition(5)
     .stream()
     .forEach(System.out::println);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And the result of all 7 integer possible partitions:
<blockquote>
<pre>
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[2, 1, 1, 1]
[2, 2, 1]
[3, 1, 1]
[3, 2]
[4, 1]
[5]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3> 7. Cartesian product</h3>
<p>This generator generates Cartesian product from specified multiple lists.
<p>Set of lists is specified in the constructor of generator to generate k-element Cartesian product,
    where k is the size of the set of lists.
<p>A simple k-element Cartesian product of a finite sets S(1), S(2)...S(k) is a set
    of all ordered pairs (x(1), x(2)...x(k), where x(1) ∈ S(1), x(2) ∈ S(2) ... x(k) ∈ S(k)
<p>Example. Generate 3-element Cartesian product from (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9).
<blockquote>
<pre>
   Generator.cartesianProduct(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3), Arrays.asList(4, 5, 6), Arrays.asList(7, 8, 9))
      .stream()
      .collect(Collectors.&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;toList());
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And the result:
<blockquote>
<pre>
   [1, 4]
   [1, 5]
   [1, 6]
   [2, 4]
   [2, 5]
   [2, 6]
   [3, 4]
   [3, 5]
   [3, 6]
</pre>
</blockquote>
